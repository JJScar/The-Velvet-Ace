what happens when a player runs out of chips in a poker game

1. Cash Game
Buying Back In:
If a player runs out of chips, they can buy more chips (re-buy) if they wish to continue playing.
The player may leave the game if they choose not to rebuy.
All-In Situations:
If a player runs out of chips during a hand, they can go "all-in" for the amount of chips they have left. A side pot is created for the remaining players who still have chips to bet.
The all-in player can only win the main pot (the chips they contributed to and any matching bets).

2. Tournament
Elimination:
In tournaments, when a player runs out of chips, they are eliminated from the game unless:
It’s a rebuy tournament, where players can purchase more chips within a certain time frame.
It’s a freeroll tournament, and there’s an option for add-ons.
All-In Situations:
Similar to cash games, if a player goes all-in, a side pot is created for other players who continue betting.
The all-in player can only win the main pot, as they have no chips left to match further bets.
